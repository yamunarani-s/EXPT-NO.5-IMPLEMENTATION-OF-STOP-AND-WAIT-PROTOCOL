# EX.NO: 5 IMPLEMENTATION OF STOP AND WAIT PROTOCOL

# AIM
To implement Stop and Wait protocol using NS2 program.

# EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED
1.	PC with ubuntu operating system
2.	NS2 Software

# ALGORITHM
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Declare the global variables ns for creating a new simulator. Step 3: Open the network animator file in the write mode.
Step 4: Open the trace file in the write mode.
Step 5: Transfer the packets in network.
Step 6: Create the capable no of nodes.
Step 7: Create the duplex-link between the nodes including the delay time, bandwidth and dropping queue mechanism.
Step 8: Set a tcp connection for source node.
Step 9: Set the destination node using tcp sink.
Step 10: Set the window size and the packet size for the tcp.
Step 11: Set up the ftp over the tcp connection.
Step 12: Define the plot window and finish procedure.
Step 13: In the definition of the finish procedure declare the global variables. 
Step 14: Close the trace file and namfile and execute the network animation file. 
Step 15: At the particular time call the finish procedure.
Step 16: Stop the program.
